      <p class="text-lg">
        As the world population continues to grow, the demand for sustainable protein sources is rapidly increasing.
        Aquaculture — the farming of fish, shellfish, and seaweed — now supplies over 50% of the global seafood market.
        It plays a critical role in global food security, offering a climate-smart way to meet the rising demand for high-quality protein.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3">Norway’s Role in Aquaculture and Salmon Farming</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Norway is a world leader in aquaculture, especially in Atlantic salmon farming. With a coastline well-suited to cold-water species,
        the country produces more than <strong>1.2 million tonnes of farmed salmon annually</strong> and exports to over 100 countries.
        Aquaculture contributes significantly to Norway’s economy and job market, involving advanced technologies, strict regulations,
        and collaboration with universities and research institutions. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Directorate of Fisheries
        enforce strong welfare and sustainability standards to ensure ethical production.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3">Why Use the Salmonometer Dashboard?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        The <strong>Salmonometer Dashboard</strong> is designed to help students, researchers, and academic institutions better understand
        the practical aspects of salmon and trout farming in Norway. By simulating real-world data collection and analysis, users gain experience
        in how production companies gather and use data to monitor fish health, performance, and environmental conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mt-4">
        The system supports collaborative learning and research by allowing users to collect and compare data in an educational context — from
        welfare indicators to water quality, production metrics, and product quality. Students and researchers can work across institutions,
        analyze trends, and build skills for future careers in the aquaculture industry.
